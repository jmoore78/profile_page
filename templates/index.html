                <h5>Background</h5>
                <p>I had the dual advantage of growing up in a small town outside of a respectable university, which happened to have a nanotech department. The slowness of a small town afforded me the opportunity to daydream about the influence of technology on the future. My childhood curiosity evolved into an excitement for the science of things and their interconnectedness.</p>
                <p>Creative problem solving and a small town compassion began to professionally sharpen through shift-leader and customer service positions in high school. Management generally required critical thinking for both customer/employee de-escalation but also strategic planning in day-to-day operations and logistics. I quickly identified compassion and persistence as a key tools for positive-sum outcomes.</p>
                <h5>Interests</h5>
                <p>I appreciate the balance of the outdoors including hiking, camping and exploring the physical world. Any activity that includes some competion always grabs my attention. Documentaries, Historical and Philosophical studies, tinkering in general and of course Sci-Fi. As a childhood cancer survivor, I'm excited about the use of technology to push past limitations. It opens so many options, especially in areas of medical science, education and mental health. Robtics and automation have always facinated me and I believe they will be vital for further space exploration.</p>
                <h5>Client-Side or Server-Side?</h5>
                <p>At the risk of sounding clich√©: both for different reasons. Client-side (or front-end) development allows me to tap on my Customer Service Management experience through visual creativity and interactivity at the user-interface level. I really enjoy that user-driven, dynamic environment.</p>
                <p>Server-side (or back-end) rewards the problem-solving part of me that I honed with Mission-Critical Facility Management. I respect the structural importance of intertwining a backend language with a database that not only supports the front-end but creates the foundation for it so many ways. Bringing them together in Full-Stack with APIs is a feeling of satisfied completion that pulls on my Project Management experience.</p>
