                            <h5>Background</h5>
                            <p>I had the dual advantage of growing up in a small town outside of a respectable university, which happened to have a nanotech department. The slowness of a small town afforded me the opportunity to daydream in reverence about the influence of technology on the ever-changing future. I always had a passion to continue learning and growing. I knew that somehow computed technology would be a part of that.</p>
                            <p>My love for creative problem solving and a small town sense of compassion began to show through early on with shift-leader and customer service positions in high school. Management in general often required critical thinking for both customer/employee de-escalation but also strategic planning in day-to-day operations. I quickly identified compassion and persistence as a key tools for resolving issues to a positive-sum outcome for everyone involved.</p>
                            <h5>Interests</h5>
                            <p>Stuff here</p>
                            <h5>Why Software Development?</h5>
                            <p>Stuff here</p>
                            <h5>Client-Side or Server-Side?</h5>
                            <p>At the risk of sounding clich√©: both, but for very different reasons. Client-side (or front-end) development allows me to tap on my Customer Service Management experience by using visual creativity and interactivity at the user-interface level. I really enjoy that user-driven, dynamic environment.</p>
                            <p>On the server-side (or back-end), I respect the structural importance of intertwining a backend language with a database that not only supports front-end but creates the foundation for it in many cases. Server-side rewards the problem-solving side of me that I forged along the way in life but honed with Mission-Critical Facility Management. Bringing them together in Full-Stack using APIs feels like creative engineering!</p>
